# hobb.Y
 hobb.Y is a  social networking application which connects users using their hobbies. Users are able to create an account, create a profile,
 create and like posts, along with writing comments to posts.
 
 The app was built using MongoDB, Express, and Node on the backend to manage the creation of user accounts, profiles, posts, comments, and likes
 and stores them, to the MongoDB database. React and Redux are used on the frontend with Redux's actions handling the functions which create and store all
 of the utilities listed in the backend into an application wide state which is passed as props. The combination of React and Redux allows the utilities 
 stored in the backend to be rendered to the frontend.
